# This file contains a table of known architecture strings, with
# things to map them to. `configure' will take the output of gcc
# --print-libgcc-file-name, strip off leading directories up to and
# including gcc-lib, strip off trailing /libgcc.a and trailing version
# number directory, and then strip off everything after the first
# hyphen.  The idea is that you're left with this bit:
#   $ gcc --print-libgcc-file-name
#   /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux/2.7.2/libgcc.a
#                    ^^^^
# This is then looked up in the table below, to find out what to map
# it to.  If it isn't found then configure will print a warning and
# continue.  You can override configure's ideas using --with-arch.
