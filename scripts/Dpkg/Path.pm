=item get_pkg_root_dir($file)

This function will scan upwards the hierarchy of directory to find out
the directory which contains the "DEBIAN" sub-directory and it will return
its path. This directory is the root directory of a package being built.

If no DEBIAN subdirectory is found, it will return undef.
