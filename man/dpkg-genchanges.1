reads information from an unpacked and built Debian source tree and
from the files it has generated and generates a Debian upload control
file
.RB ( .changes " file)."
.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-v version
Causes changelog information from all versions strictly later than
.I version
to be used.
.TP
.BI \-C changesdescription

.I changesdescription
rather than using the information from the source tree's changelog
file.
.TP
.BI \-m maintaineraddress
Use
.I maintaineraddress
as the name and email address of the maintainer for this package,
rather than using the information from the source tree's control file.
.TP

Use
.I maintaineraddress
as the name and email address of the maintainer for this upload,
rather than using the information from the source tree's changelog.
.TP
.BR \-si ", " \-sa ", " \-sd
These options control whether the original source archive is included
in the upload generated by
.BR dpkg\-genchanges
if any source is being generated (i.e.,
.BR \-b " or " \-B
haven't been used).

By default, or if
.B \-si
is specified, the original source will be included if the version
number ends in
.BR \-0 " or " \-1 ,
i.e. if the Debian revision part of the version number is
.BR 0 " or " 1 .

.B \-sa
forces the inclusion of the original source;
.B \-sd
forces its exclusion and includes only the diff.
.TP
.BI \-V name = value
Set an output substitution variable.
See \fBdeb\-substvars\fP(5) for a discussion of output substitution.
.TP
.BI \-T substvarsfile
Read substitution variables in

the default is

.BI \-D field = value
Override or add an output control file field.

.BR \-b ", " \-B ", " \-S
For
.BR dpkg\-genchanges " and " dpkg\-buildpackage
.BR \-b " and " \-B
specify that a binary-only build is taking place.
.B \-b
indicates that no source files are to be built and/or distributed, and
.B \-B
that no architecture-independent binary package files are to be
distributed either.
.B \-S
specifies that only the source should be uploaded and no binary packages
need to be made. The distinction between
.BR \-b " and " \-B
is only used by
.BR dpkg\-buildpackage ;
.B dpkg\-genchanges
just produces a
.B .changes
file for whatever files were produced by the
.B binary\-*
target(s) of the package being built.
