.SH NAME
dpkg\-shlibdeps
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dpkg\-shlibdeps
.RI [ options ]
.IR executable | \fB-e\fPexecutable
.RI [ options ]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dpkg\-shlibdeps
calculates shared library dependencies for executables named in its
arguments. The dependencies are added to the substitution
variables file
.B debian/substvars
as variable names
.BI shlibs: dependencyfield
where
.I dependencyfield
is a dependency field name. Any other variables starting
.I shlibs:
are removed from the file.
.B dpkg\-shlibdeps
will read shared library dependency information from
.BR debian/shlibs.local ,
.BR /etc/dpkg/shlibs.override ,
the
.B shlibs
control area file of the package containing the file which
.B objdump
reports as satisfying the library dependency, or
.BR /etc/dpkg/shlibs.default .
The first match will be used.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.B dpkg\-shlibdeps
interprets non-option arguments as executable names, just as if they'd
been supplied as
.BI \-e executable\fR.
.TP
.BI \-e executable
Include dependencies appropriate for the shared libraries required by
.IR executable .
.TP
.BI \-d dependencyfield
Add dependencies to be added to the control file dependency field
.IR dependencyfield .
(The dependencies for this field are placed in the variable
.BI shlibs: dependencyfield\fR.)

The
.BI \-d dependencyfield
option takes effect for all executables after the option, until the
next
.BI \-d dependencyfield\fR.
The default
.I dependencyfield
is
.BR Depends .

If the same dependency entry (or set of alternatives) appears in more
than one of the recognised dependency field names
.BR Pre\-Depends ", " Depends ", " Recommends ", " Enhances " or " Suggests
then
.B dpkg\-shlibdeps
will automatically remove the dependency from all fields except the
one representing the most important dependencies.
.TP
.BI \-p varnameprefix
Start substitution variables with
.IB varnameprefix :
instead of
.BR shlibs: .
Likewise, any existing substitution variables starting with
.IB varnameprefix :
(rather than
.BR shlibs: )
are removed from the the substitution variables file.
.TP
.B \-O
Print substitution variable settings to standard output, rather than being
added to the substitution variables file
.RB ( debian/substvars
by default).
.TP
.BI \-t type
Prefer shared library dependency information tagged for the given
package type. If no tagged information is available, falls back to untagged
information. The default package type is "deb". Shared library dependency
information is tagged for a given type by prefixing it with the name of the
type, a colon, and whitespace.
.TP
.BI \-L localshlibsfile
Read overriding shared library dependency information from
.I localshlibsfile
instead of
.BR debian/shlibs.local .
.TP
.BI \-T substvarsfile
Write substitution variables in
.IR substvarsfile ;
the default is
.BR debian/substvars .
.TP
.BI \-\-admindir= dir
Change the location of the \fBdpkg\fR database. The default location is
\fI/var/lib/dpkg\fP.
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Show the usage message and exit.
.TP
.BR \-\-version
Show the version and exit.
.
.SH FILES

.B debian/shlibs.local

.TP
.B /etc/dpkg/shlibs.override
Per-system overriding shared library dependency information.
.TP
