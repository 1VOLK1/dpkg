    <title>Description</title>

    <para>
      <command>dselect</command> is the primary user interface for managing
      packages on a Debian system. At the <command>dselect</command> main menu,
      the system administrator can:

    <para>
      <command>dselect</command> operates as a front-end to
      <command>>dpkg</command>, the medium-level debian package handling tool.
      It features a full-screen package selections manager with package depends
      and conflicts resolver. When run with adminitrator priviledges, packages
      can be installed, upgraded and removed. Various access methods can be
      configured to retrieve available package version information and
      installable packages from package repositories.  Depending on the used
      access method, these repositories can be public archive servers on the
      internet, local archive servers or cdroms.  The recommended access method
      is <emphasis>apt</emphasis>, which is provided by the package
      <productname>apt</productname>.
    </para>

    <para>
      Normally <command>dselect</command> is invoked without parameters.  An
      interactive menu is presented, offering the user a list of actions.  If
      an action is given as argument, then that action is started immediately.
      Several commandline parameters are still available to modify the running
      behaviour of <command>dselect</command> or show additional information
      about the program.
    </para>

  <refsect1>
    <title>Options</title>

    <para>
      All options can be specified both on the commandline and in the
      <command>dselect</command> configuration file
      <filename>/etc/dpkg/dselect.cfg</filename>. Each line in the
      configuration file is either an option (exactly the same as the
      commandline option but without leading dashes) or a comment (if it starts
      with a hash `#' sign).

	  </para>

	  <para>
	    By default, <command>dselect</command> provides several methods such
	    as <emphasis>floppy</emphasis>, <emphasis>harddisk</emphasis> or
	    <emphasis>cdrom</emphasis>, but other packages may provide additional
	    methods, eg. the <emphasis>apt</emphasis> access method provided by
	    the <productname>apt</productname> package or
	    <emphasis>multi_cd</emphasis> by the
	    <productname>dpkg-multicd</productname> package.
	  </para>

	  <note>
	    <para>
	      The use of the <emphasis>apt</emphasis> access method is strongly

	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Refresh the available packages database.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Retrieves a list of available package versions from the package
	    repository, configured for the current access method, and update
	    the dpkg database. The package lists are commonly provided by the
	    repository as files named <filename>Packages</filename> or
	    <filename>Packages.gz</filename>. These files can be generated by
	    repository maintainers, using the program
	    <command>dpkg-scanpackages</command>.  
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Details of the update action depend on the access method's
	    implementation. Normally the process is straightforward and
	    requires no user interaction.

	  <para>
	    View or manage package selections and dependencies.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    This is the main function of <command>dselect</command>. In the
	    select screen, the user can review a list of all available and
	    installed packages. When run with administrator privileges, it is
	    also possible to interactively change packages selection state.
	    <command>dselect</command> tracks the implications of these changes
	    to other depending or conflicting packages.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    When a conflict or failed depends is detected, a dependency
	    resolution subscreen is prompted to the user. In this screen, a
	    list of conflicting or depending packages is shown, and for each
	    package listed, the reason for its listing is shown. The user may
	    apply the suggestions proposed by <command>dselect</command>,
	    override them, or back out all the changes, including the ones that
	    created the unresolved depends or conflicts.

	<term>Install</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Installs selected packages.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The configured access method will fetch installable or upgradable
	    packages from the relevant repositories and install these using
	    <command>dpkg</command>.  Depending on the implementation of the
	    access method, all packages can be prefetched before installation,
	    or fetched when needed.  Some access methods may also remove
	    packages that were marked for removal.
	  <para>

	  <para>
	    If an error occurred during install, it is usually advisable to run
	    install again.  In most cases, the problems will disappear or be
	    solved.  If problems persist or the installation performed was
	    incorrect, please investigate into the causes and circumstances,
	    and file a bug in the Debian bug tracking system.  Instructions on
	    how to do this can be found at <ulink
	    url='http://bugs.debian.org/'>http://bugs.debian.org/</ulink> or by
	    reading the documentation for <command>bug</command> or
	    <command>reportbug</command>, if these are installed.
	  <para>

	  <para>
	    Details of the install action depend on the access method's
	    implementation.  The user's attention and input may be required
	    during installation, configuration or removal of packages.  This
	    depends on the maintainer scripts in the package.  Some packages
	    make use of the <productname>>debconf</productname> library,
	    allowing for more flexible or even automated installation setups.

      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>
	<command>dselect</command> directly exposes
	the administrator to some of the complexities involved with managing
	large sets of packages with many interdependencies.  For a user who is
	unfamiliar with the concepts and the ways of the debian package
	management system, it can be quite overwhelming.  Although <emphasis
	remap='B'>dselect</emphasis> is aimed at easing package management and
	administration, it is only instrumental in doing so and can not be
	assumed to be a sufficient substitute for administrator skill and
	understanding.  The user is required to be familiar with the concepts
	underlying the Debian packaging system.  In case of doubt, consult the
	<citerefentry><refentrytitle>dpkg</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>
	manpage and the Debian policy manual.
      </para>

      <para>
	Unless <command>dselect</command> is run in expert or immediate mode, a
	help screen is first displayed when choosing this action from the menu.
	The user is <emphasis>strongly</emphasis> advised to study all of the
	information presented in the online help screens, when one pops up.
	The online help screens can at any time be invoked with the
	<keycap>?</keycap> key.
      </para>
    </refsect2>

    <refsect2>
      <title>Screen Layout</title>

      <para>
	The select screen is by default split in a top and a bottom half.  The
	top half shows a list of packages.  A cursor bar can select an
	individual package, or a group of packages, if applicable, by selecting
	the group header.  The bottom half of the screen shows some details
	about the package currently selected in the top half of the screen.
	The type of detail that is displayed can be varied.
      </para>

      <para>
	Pressing the <keycap>I</keycap> key toggles a full-screen display of
	the packages list, an enlarged view of the package details, or the
	equally split screen.
      </para>
    </refsect2>

    <refsect2>
      <title>Package Details View</title>

      <para>
	The package details view by default shows the extended package
	description for the package that is currently selected in the packages
	status list.  The type of detail can be toggled by pressing the
	<keycap>i</keycap> key. This alternates between:
      </para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
	  <para>
	    the extended description

	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    the control information for the available version
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>
	In a dependency resolution screen, there is also the possibility of
	viewing the specific unresolved depends or conflicts related to the
	package and causing it to be listed.
      </para>
    </refsect2>

    <refsect2>
      <title>Packages Status List</title>

      <para>
	The main select screen displays a list of all packages known to the
	debian package management system.  This includes packages installed on
	the system and packages known from the available packages database.  
      </para>

      <para>
	For every package, the list shows the package's status, priority,
	section, installed and available versions, the package name and its
	short description, all in one line.  By pressing the <keycap>V</keycap>
	key, the display of the installed and available version can be toggled
	between on an off. By pressing the <keycap>v</keycap> key, the package
	status display is toggled between verbose and shorthand. Shorthand
	display is the default.
      </para>

      <para>
	The shorthand status indication consists of four parts:  an error flag,
	which should normally be clear, the current status, the last selection
	state and the current selection state.  The first two relate to the
	actual state of the package, the second pair are about the selections
	set by the user.
      </para>

      <para>
        These are the meanings of the shorthand package status indicator codes:

      <title>Searching And Sorting</title>

      <para>
	The list of packages can be searched by package name. This is done by
	pressing <keycap>/</keycap>, and typing a simple search string. The
	string is interpreted as a
	<citerefentry><refentrytitle>regex</refentrytitle><manvolnum>7</manvolnum></citerefentry>
	regular expression. If you add `<emphasis>/d</emphasis>' to the search
	expression, dselect will also search in descriptions. If you add
	`<emphasis>/i</emphasis>' the search will be case insensitive. You may
	combine these two suffixes like this: `<emphasis>'/id'</emphasis>.
	Repeated searching is accomplished by repeatedly pressing the
	<keycap>n</keycap> or <keycap>\</keycap> keys, until the wanted package
	is found. If the search reaches the bottom of the list, it wraps to
	the top and continues searching from there.
      </para>

      <para>
	The list sort order can be varied by pressing the <keycap>o</keycap>
	and <keycap>O</keycap> keys repeatedly. The following nine sort
	orderings can be selected:
      </para>

      <para>
 alphabet          available           status
 priority+section  available+priority  status+priority
 section+priority  available+section   status+section
      </para>

      <para>
	Where not listed above explicitly, alphabetic order is used as the
	final subordering sort key.

      <para>
	When the change request results in one or more unsatisfied depends or
	conflicts, <command>dselect</command> prompts the user with a
	dependency resolution screen. This will be further explained below.
      </para>

      <para>
	It is also possible to apply these commands to groups of package
	selections, by pointing the cursor bar onto a group header.  The exact
	grouping of packages is dependent on the current
	list ordering settings.  
      </para>

      <para>
	Proper care should be taken when altering large groups of selections,
	because this can instantaneously create large numbers of unresolved
	depends or conflicts, all of which will be listed in one dependency
	resolution screen, making them very hard to handle. In practice, only
	hold and unhold operations are useful when applied to groups.

      <title>Resolving Depends And Conflicts</title>

      <para>
	When the change request results in one or more unsatisfied depends or
	conflicts, <command>dselect</command> prompts the user with a
	dependency resolution screen. First however, an informative help
	screen is displayed. 
      </para>

      <para>
	The top half of this screen lists all the packages that will have
	unresolved depends or conflicts, as a result of the requested change,
	and all the packages whose installation can resolve any of these
	depends or whose removal can resolve any of the conflicts.  The bottom
	half defaults to show the depends or conflicts that cause the currently
	selected package to be listed.
      </para>

      <para>
	When the sublist of packages is displayed initially,
	<command>dselect</command> may have already set the requested selection
	status of some of the listed packages, in order to resolve the depends
	of conflicts that caused the dependency resolution screen to be
	displayed.  Usually, it is best to follow up the suggestions made by
	<command>dselect</command>.
      </para>

      <para>
	The listed packages' selection state may be reverted to the original
	settings, as they were before the unresolved depends or conflicts were
	created, by pressing the <keycap>R</keycap> key. By pressing the
	<keycap>D</keycap> key, the automatic suggestions are reset, but the
	change that caused the dependency resolution screen to be prompted is
	kept as requested.  Finally, by pressing <keycap>U</keycap>, the
	selections are again set to the automatic suggestion values.

      <title>Establishing The Requested Selections</title>

      <para>
	By pressing <keycap>Enter</keycap>, the currently displayed set of
	selections is accepted. If <command>dselect</command> detects no
	unresolved depends as a result of the requested selections, the new
	selections will be set. However, if there are any unresolveded
	depends, <command>dselect</command> will again prompt the user with a
	dependency resolution screen.  
      </para>

      <para>
	To alter a set of selections that creates unresolved depends or
	conflicts and forcing <command>dselect</command> to accept it, press
	the <keycap>Q</keycap> key. This sets the selections as specified by
	the user, unconditionally. Generally, don't do this unless you've read
	the fine print.
      </para>

      <para>
	The opposite effect, to back out any selections change requests and go
	back to the previous list of selections, is attained by pressing the
	<keycap>X</keycap> or <keycap>Escape</keycap> keys. By repeatedly
	pressing these keys, any possibly detrimental changes to the requested
	package selections can be backed out completely to the last established
	settings.

      The visible list of available packages cannot be reduced.

      The built in access methods can no longer stand up to current quality
      standards. Use the access method provided by
      <productname>apt</productname>, it is not only not broken, it is also
      much more flexible than the built in access methods.
