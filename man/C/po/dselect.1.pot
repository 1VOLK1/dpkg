"is one of the primary user interfaces for managing packages on a Debian\n"

"B<dselect> operates as a front-end to B<dpkg(8)>, the low-level debian "
"package handling tool.  It features a full-screen package selections manager "
"with package depends and conflicts resolver.  When run with adminitrator "
"priviledges, packages can be installed, upgraded and removed. Various access "
"methods can be configured to retrieve available package version information "
"and installable packages from package repositories.  Depending on the used "
"access method, these repositories can be public archive servers on the "
