"Each Debian package contains the master `control' file, which contains a "
"number of fields.  Each field begins with a tag, such as B<Package> or "
"B<Version> (case insensitive), followed by a colon, and the body of the "
"field.  Fields are delimited only by field tags.  In other words, field text "
"may be multiple lines in length, but the installation tools will generally "
"join lines when processing the body of the field (except in the case of the "
"B<Description> field, see below)."
