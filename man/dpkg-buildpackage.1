dpkg\-buildpackage \- build source packages
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dpkg\-buildpackage
.RI [ options ]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dpkg\-buildpackage
is a control script which can be used to help automate the building of
a package.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-b
Specifies a binary-only build, no source files are to be built and/or
distributed, and
.TP
.B \-B
Specifies a binary-only build, no architecture independent binary package
files are to be distributed either.
.TP
.B \-S
Specifies a source-only build, no binary packages need to be made.
.PP
These options control whether the original source archive is included
in the upload generated by
.BR dpkg\-buildpackage
if any source is being generated (i.e.,
.BR \-b " or " \-B
haven't been used).
.TP
.B \-si
Include the original source if the version number ends in
.BR \-0 " or " \-1 ,
i.e. if the Debian revision part of the version number is
.BR 0 " or " 1 .
.B This is the default.
.TP
.B \-sa
Forces the inclusion of the original source.
.TP
.B \-sd
Forces the exclusion of the original source and includes only the diff.
.TP
.BI \-a architecture
Specify the Debian architecture we build for. The architecture of the
machine we build on is determined automatically, and is also the default
for the host machine.
.TP
.BI \-v version
Use changelog information from all versions strictly later than
.IR version .
.TP
.BI \-C changesdescription
Read the description of the changes from the file
.I changesdescription
rather than using the information from the source tree's changelog file.
.TP
.BI \-m maintaineraddress
Use
.I maintaineraddress
as the name and email address of the maintainer for this package,
rather than using the information from the source tree's control file.
.TP
.BI \-e maintaineraddress
Use
.I maintaineraddress
as the name and email address of the maintainer for this upload,
rather than using the information from the source tree's changelog.
.TP
.B \-D
Check build dependencies and conflicts; abort if unsatisfied.
.TP
.B \-d
Do not check build dependencies and conflicts.
.TP
.BI \-W
Turn certain errors into warnings. Only \fBdpkg\-source\fP uses this, but
.BR dpkg\-buildpackage
recognizes it, and passes it thru to
.BR dpkg\-source "."
.TP
.BI \-E
Negates a previously set
.BR \-W "."
Only \fBdpkg\-source\fP uses this, but
.BR dpkg\-buildpackage
recognizes it, and passes it thru to
.BR dpkg\-source "."
.TP
.B \-nc
Do not clean the source tree (implies \fB\-b\fP).
.TP
.B \-tc
Clean the source tree (using
.I gain-root-command
.BR "debian/rules clean" )
after the package has been built.
.TP
.BI \-r gain-root-command
When
.B dpkg\-buildpackage
needs to execute part of the build process as root, it prefixes the
command it executes with
.I gain-root-command
if one has been specified.
.I gain-root-command
should be the name of a program on the
.B PATH
and will get as arguments the name of the real command to run and the
arguments it should take.
.I gain-root-command
should not contain spaces or any other shell metacharacters.
.\" what happens, if it contains spaces? (hs)
.I gain-root-command
might typically be
.BR fakeroot ", " sudo ", " super " or " really .
.B su
is not suitable, since it requires a
.B \-c
option to run a command and even then it can only invoke the user's
shell with
.B \-c
instead of passing arguments individually to the command to be run.
.TP
.BI \-p sign-command
When
.B dpkg\-buildpackage
needs to execute GPG or PGP to sign a source control
.RB ( .dsc )
file or a
.B .changes
file it will run
.I sign-command
(searching the
.B PATH
if necessary) instead of
.BR pgp .
.I sign-command
will get all the arguments that
.B pgp
would have gotten. If
.I sign-command
takes its arguments in GPG rather than PGP style, you should give
the
.B \-sgpg
option.
.I sign-command
should not contain spaces or any other shell metacharacters.
.TP
.BI \-k key-id
Specify a key-ID to use when signing packages.
.TP
.BR \-us
Do not sign the source package.
.TP
.BR \-uc
Do not sign the .changes file.
.TP
.BR \-i [\fIregexp\fP]
Passed unchanged to
.BR dpkg\-source .
.TP
.BI \-I filename
Passed unchanged to
.BR dpkg\-source .
May be repeated multiple times.
.TP
.BI \-\-admindir= dir
Change the location of the \fBdpkg\fR database. The default location is
\fI/var/lib/dpkg\fP.
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Show the usage message and exit.
.TP
.BR \-\-version
Show the version and exit.
.
.SH BUGS
It should be possible to specify spaces and shell metacharacters in
and initial arguments for
.IR gain-root-command " and " sign-command .
