Description: Package maintenance system for Debian Linux
 This package contains the programs which handle the installation and
 removal of packages on your system.
 .
 The primary interface for the dpkg suite is the `dselect' program;
 a more low-level and less user-friendly interface is available in
 the form of the `dpkg' command.
 .
 In order to manipulate source packages using `dpkg-source' you will
 need to install the `cpio' and `patch' packages.
