Description: Package maintenance system for Debian Linux
 This package contains the programs which handle the installation and
 removal of packages on your system.
 .
 The primary interface for the dpkg suite is the `dselect' program;
 a more low-level and less user-friendly interface is available in
 the form of the `dpkg' command.
 .
 In order to unpack and build Debian source packages you will need to
 install the developers' package `dpkg-dev' as well as this one.

Description: Package building tools for Debian Linux
 This package contains the tools (including dpkg-source) required to
 unpack, build and upload Debian source packages.  It also contains
 the programmers' and Debian policy manuals, which are the
 documentation for package developers.
 .
 `cpio' and `patch' are also required to manipulate source packages.
 Some older cpios are insufficient - use at least 2.4.2-2.
 .
 Most Debian source packages will require additional tools to build -
 for example, most packages need the `make' and the C compiler `gcc'.
