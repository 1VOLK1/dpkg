  Generally the following compilation parameters should be used:
  
  @display
-         CC = gcc
-         CFLAGS = -O2
-         LDFLAGS = -s (and -N, if appropriate; see below)
  @end display
  
  All installed binaries should be stripped, hence @code{-s}.  @code{-N}
  should only be used on binaries that are very small (less than 8K with
  the @code{-N} option, roughly) and are not likely to have multiple
- instances in memory.  Do not use @code{-N} on daemons, no matter how
  small they are.
  
  It is up to the package maintainer to decide what compilation options
